  #   | Okay, I need to find the first 1000 words of the Bible. Let me start by recalling the beginning of Genesis. The first words are "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." That's Genesis 1:1. Then it goes on to describe the creation of the world, light, sky, water, plants, sun and moon, animals, and humans.
  #   | 
  #   | I should check the exact wording in Genesis 1. The user probably wants the actual text, ... Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.  
  #   | 3. And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord.  
  #   | 4. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering.
